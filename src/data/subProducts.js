The purpose of the jacket is to regulate the temperature of the reaction inside the core vessel. The reactor itself is typically made of glass, stainless steel, or metal (depending on if the experiment is taking place in a laboratory, pilot plant, etc.) with an inner vessel that holds the reactants and an outer jacket that circulates a heat transfer fluid, such as water or oil. This set-up allows the temperature of the reactants to be controlled by regulating the temperature of the heat transfer fluid."
